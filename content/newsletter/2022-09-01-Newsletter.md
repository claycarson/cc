This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.

You can follow me more closely at [my personal website](http://claycarson.net "Personal Website") or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to [my real estate website](http://claycarson.com "Business Website ").

## Tsundoku

[All Those Books You’ve Bought but Haven’t Read? There’s a Word for That](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/books/review/personal-libraries.html "All Those Books You’ve Bought but Haven’t Read? There’s a Word for That")

> A person’s library is often a symbolic representation of his or her mind. A man who has quit expanding his personal library may have reached the point where he thinks he knows all he needs to and that what he doesn’t know can’t hurt him. He has no desire to keep growing intellectually. The man with an ever-expanding library understands the importance of remaining curious, open to new ideas and voices.

## Fajita People

[The Fajita Effect](https://medium.com/galleys/the-fajita-effect-504838a5f2f0 "The Fajita Effect")

> The restaurant chain didn’t do fajitas first or best, but it did them loudest. It even put the sizzling sound in its first TV ad. While other restaurants tried to make fajitas that tasted better or looked fancier than the competition’s, Chili’s kept the recipe simple and relied primarily on the sizzle to not only turn heads but also trigger a barrage of senses: you hear them, then you notice the smoke and smell the aroma. Add up all of that, and you don’t just taste or see a neat-looking dish with Chili’s sizzling fajitas. You experience it.

## Chit Chat

[Good conversations have lots of doorknobs](https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/good-conversations-have-lots-of-doorknobs "Good conversations have lots of doorknobs")

> Givers think that conversations unfold as a series of invitations; takers think conversations unfold as a series of declarations. When giver meets giver or taker meets taker, all is well. When giver meets taker, however, giver gives, taker takes, and giver gets resentful (“Why won’t he ask me a single question?”) while taker has a lovely time (“She must really think I’m interesting!”) or gets annoyed (“My job is so boring, why does she keep asking me about it?”).
> […]
> Neither givers nor takers have it 100% correct, and their conflicts often come from both sides’ insistence that the other side must convert or die. Rather than mounting a Inquisition on our interlocutors, we ought to focus on perfecting our own technique. And the way to do that, I think, is by adding a bunch of doorknobs.

## RIP Yahoo Answers

['How Do You Get Spaghetti Stains Out of Underwear?': An Ode to Yahoo Answers](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a36053000/yahoo-answers-shutting-down-mbmbam-my-brother-my-brother-and-me-tribute-justin-mcelroy/ "'How Do You Get Spaghetti Stains Out of Underwear?': An Ode to Yahoo Answers")

> We enter and leave this world alone, but spend the time in between seeking connection. It’s the human experience. But when we’ve strayed too far from the pack, when we’re at our most ashamed, our most lost, our most … too high, Yahoo Answers was there to lead us back home.

The McElroy brother’s podcast, [My Brother, My Brother, and Me](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/my-brother-my-brother-and-me "My Brother, My Brother, and Me") is fantastic — pick any episode. I’m not sure how they do it but the brothers somehow have new listeners clued in to all the inside and running jokes within an episode or two.

## Tell Tale

[The Honor System](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a15810/teller-magician-interview-1012/ "The Honor System")

> Until Bakardy came along, Teller had never needed his copyright filings to stake a claim. "It's not like good manners and generosity are inappropriate ways to behave in the world," he says. When he has contacted light-fingered magicians in the past, they have always apologized and stopped performing the trick. For instance, he does a trick in which he spills handfuls of coins into a tank filled with water, and they somehow turn into living, breathing goldfish. It's a throat-catching effect, and a magician in Sweden, who had seen Teller performing the trick on TV, studied the tape and finally lifted it. After Teller called him, the magician said sorry, boxed up his props in a crate, minus the fish, and shipped them to Las Vegas.
> 
> This time around, Teller offered to pay Gerard Bakardy several thousand dollars for the time he spent working on the Rose & Her Shadow. He had to promise only that he would stop performing and selling the trick. Bakardy, after asking whether Teller might help him bring Los Dos de Amberes to America, countered with a higher price. No one will confirm exactly what that amount was, but it was allegedly more than $100,000. "It really wasn't possible for me to come to any terms," Teller says. "It ended up having certain elements that reminded me of a kidnapping."

> Teller, who had already persuaded YouTube to take down the offending video, asked Bakardy whether his demands were firm. Bakardy said they were.
> 
> Teller had a decision to make.

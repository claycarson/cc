This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.

## His Name Was Emmett Till

[His Name Was Emmett Till](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/09/barn-emmett-till-murder/619493/?utm_source=pocket_mylist)

> In 1955 an all-white, all-male jury, encouraged by the defense to do their duty as “Anglo-Saxons,” acquitted J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant. Because the defendants couldn’t be tried again, they got paid to make a confession to a national magazine—a heavily fictionalized account stage-managed by their lawyers—and Leslie Milam and his barn were written out of the story. Ask most people where Till died and they’ll say Money, Mississippi, the town where Till whistled at Bryant’s wife outside the family’s store. An Equal Justice Initiative monument in Montgomery says Money. Wikipedia does too. The Library of Congress website skips over the barn, which is just outside the town of Drew, about 45 minutes from the store.
> 
> I learned about the barn last year and have since made repeated visits, alone and with groups, once with members of Till’s family. Over and over, I drove from my home in the Mississippi hill country back into the gothic flatland where I was born. The barn’s existence conjures a complex set of reactions: It is a mourning bench for Black Americans, an unwelcome mirror for white Americans. It both repels and demands attention.

## Kim + Im

[Two South Korean golfers will play these Olympics with everything to lose](https://www.golfdigest.com/story/south-korean-olympic-golfers-military-service)

> In the pyramid of professional golf, these two 20-somethings enjoy the view from tip-top. Their careers are the envy of countless grinders out there clawing for a breakthrough. And yet, in the eyes of the South Korean government, Im and Kim are but two able-bodied men with an unpaid debt to their country.
> 
> This week, both Im and Kim will be reunited with avoidance pressure of the highest order. In anticipation of perhaps the most important tournament of their lives, both men took the extraordinary step of skipping the Open Championship to devote their entire focus to the Olympics. Can you blame them? A medal would exempt them from mandatory military service. A fourth-place finish or worse—well, they’d prefer not to think about that.

## “I don’t know how…”

[A Round with Tiger: Celebrity Playing Lessons - Jada Pinkett Smith](https://www.golfdigest.com/video/a-round-with-tiger--celebrity-playing-lessons/a-round-with-tiger--celebrity-playing-lessons---jada-pinkett-smith)

This is some weird cross between a date, an interview, a golf lesson, and motherly wisdom. Tiger's discomfort and Jada's conviction in explaining what his story means is freaking awesome.

Tiger leaning forward and saying, “I don’t know how…” to see that people find his journey inspiring.

## Penniless

[Why a Victoria man has gone two decades without money](https://www.capitaldaily.ca/news/penniless-two-decades-without-money "Penniless: why a Victoria man has gone two decades without money")

> His last purchases — beer, cigarettes, pot — occurred 18 years ago, he says, on his 31st birthday. He claims he hasn’t spent any money since. It’s true, his friends have told me. No money at all.

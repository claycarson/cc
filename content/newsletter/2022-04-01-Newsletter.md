## The Third Man

[The forgotten Black Power hero](https://www.cnn.com/2012/04/24/sport/olympics-norman-black-power/index.html)

> Smith and Carlos had already decided to make a statement on the podium. They were to wear black gloves. But Carlos left his at the Olympic village. It was Norman who suggested they should wear one each on alternate hands. Yet Norman had no means of making a protest of his own. So he asked a member of the U.S. rowing team for his “Olympic Project for Human Rights” badge, so that he could show solidarity.
> 
> “He came up to me and said, ‘Have you got one of those buttons, mate,’ ” said U.S. rower Paul Hoffman. “If a white Australian is going to ask me for an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge, then by God he would have one. I only had one, which was mine, so I took it off and gave it to him.”
> 
> The three men walked towards their destiny. The medals were handed out before the three turned towards the flags and the start of the Star Spangled Banner.
 
## Lots of Lines

> "It's funny," I told Flewin. "We have an old Nintendo Game Boy floating around the house, and Tetris is the only game we own. My wife will sometimes dig it out to play on airplanes and long car rides. She's weirdly good at it. She can get 500 or 600 lines, no problem."
> 
> What Flewin said next I will never forget.
> 
> "Oh, my!"
> 
> After I hung up the phone, I went to the bedroom and woke my wife, Lori.
> 
> "Honey," I said. "You're not going to believe this, but I just got off the phone with a guy who's in charge of video game world records, and he said the world record for Game Boy Tetris is 327 lines, and he wants us to go to New Hampshire this spring so you can try to break the world record live in front of the judges at the world's largest classic video game tournament.
